The second term is the sum of the first term, which is 1. The third term is the sum of the first two terms, which is 1 + 1 = 2. The fourth term is the sum of the first three terms, which is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. We can see that each term is the sum of all previous terms. This means that the nth term is actually 2^(n-2) for n > 2. To find the first term that exceeds 5000, we need to solve the inequality 2^(n-2) > 5000. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get n - 2 > log2(5000). Solving for n, we find n > log2(5000) + 2. Since log2(5000) is approximately 12.29, n > 14.29.

What is the probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal?\nAssistant: <think>", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that exactly three dice show even numbers and three dice show odd numbers when six 6-sided dice are rolled. A 6-sided die has 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6) and 3 odd numbers (1, 3, 5). The probability of rolling an even number is 1/2, and the same goes for rolling an odd number. We can use the binomial probability formula to find the probability of getting exactly three even numbers (and thus three odd numbers) in six rolls. The formula is P(X=k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k), where n is the number of trials (6 in this case), k is the number of successes (3 even numbers), p is the probability of success (1/2), and C(n, k) is the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time. Plugging in the values, we get P(X=3) = C(6, 3) * (1/2)^3 * (1/2)^(6-3) = 20 * (1/2)^6 = 20 * 1/64 = 5/16. Therefore, the probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal is 5/16.</think> <answer> 5/16 </answer>", "ground_truth": "\\frac{5}{16}", "advantage": 0.5400605201721191, "reward": 1.0, "format_reward": 1.0, "answer_reward": 1.0}

The determinant of the matrix is\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\na & b & c \\\\\nb & c & a \\\\\nc & a & b\n\\end{vmatrix} = a(c^2 - ab) - b(bc - ac) + c(ab - c^2) = 0.\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = 0$, which can be factored as $(a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) = 0$. Since $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc = \\frac{1}{2}((a - b)^2 + (a - c)^2 + (b - c)^2) \\geq 0$, the only way for the product to be zero is if $a + b + c = 0$. \nSubstituting $c = -a - b$ into the expression we need to evaluate, we get\n\\[\n\\frac{a}{b - a - b} + \\frac{b}{a - a - b} + \\frac{-a - b}{a + b - a} = \\frac{a}{-a} + \\frac{b}{-b} + \\frac{-a - b}{b} = -1 - 1 - 1 = -3.\n\\]\nThus, the only possible value is $-3$. </think> <answer> -3 </answer>", "ground_truth": "-3", "advantage": 0.935412585735321, "reward": 1.0, "format_reward": 1.0, "answer_reward": 1.0}

Assuming these probabilities are independent, what is the probability that it rains over the weekend (that is, on at least one of the days)? Express your answer as a percentage.\nAssistant: <think>", "response": "To find the probability that it rains on at least one of the days, it's easier to first calculate the probability that it doesn't rain on both days and then subtract that from 100%. The probability that it doesn't rain on Saturday is 1 - 40% = 60%, and the probability that it doesn't rain on Sunday is 1 - 50% = 50%. Since the events are independent, we multiply these probabilities to find the chance that it doesn't rain on both days: $60\\% \\times 50\\% = 30\\%$. Therefore, the probability that it rains on at least one day is 100% - 30% = 70%.
