# Supervised Fine-Tuning Track

This directory contains my Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) implementation, training experiments,and relevant evaluation scripts. I’m loosely following the SFT portion of Stanford's [CS336](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/) course's [Assignment 5](https://github.com/stanford-cs336/assignment5-alignment) (both the main and supplementary parts). Once the core SFT and evaluation code are ready, I plan to explore additional experiments and potential improvements.

## To Do
- [ ] Setup vLLM for offline batched inference
